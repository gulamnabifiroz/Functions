## Aim

To create a C++ program that swaps the values of two integers using pointer-based function.

## Software Used

- Dev C++

## Theory

<p>
  In C++, pointers are variables that hold the memory address of another variable. By using pointers, you can directly manipulate the values of variables in memory. In this program, a function swap takes two pointers as parameters and swaps the values stored at those addresses.
</p>
Pointer: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
<br>
Dereferencing: Accessing the value at the memory address stored in a pointer.
<br>
Function Arguments by Reference: Using pointers to pass arguments by reference to a function allows modifying the original variables.
<br>

## Algorithm
Step 1: Start
<br>
Step 2: Define a function swap that takes two integer pointers as parameters:
<br>
Swap the values pointed to by the pointers using a temporary variable.
<br>
Step 3: In the main function:
<br>
Declare two integer variables a and b.
<br>
Get values for a and b from the user.
<br>
Call the swap function with the addresses of a and b.
<br>
Display the values of a and b after swapping.
<br>
Step 4: Stop
<br>

## Conclusion
<p>
  In this experiment, we created a C++ program to swap two integer values using pointers. We learned how to use pointers to pass arguments by reference to a function and modify the original variables.
